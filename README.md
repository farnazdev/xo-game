# XO Game – Windows Forms App

## Getting Started

XO Game is a simple yet fully functional implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, developed using C# and Windows Forms (WinForms) in Visual Studio.
This project was created during the first year of my Computer Science studies and earned a top-ranked place in a provincial student competition.

🏆 This project was submitted to a regional student competition and proudly achieved a top-10 provincial rank.
It marks one of my earliest experiences in software development and user interface design.

##  How It Works

1. The application launches a 3x3 grid of buttons representing the game board
2. Two players take turns clicking the cells to place X or O
3. After each move, the app checks for a win or draw
4. Game result is shown with the option to restart the match

✅ Player turns
🎯 Move validation
🏁 Game end state (win/draw)
